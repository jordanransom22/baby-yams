                    <p>This novel follows a young, nameless girl as she struggles through the unknown and seemingly realistic horrors of childhood. What happened to her that made her so afraid to go to the bathroom at night? How did she get a prominent scar on the left side of her head? The answers to these illusively inane questions may leave you stunned and unsettled.</p>
